## The Teaching Approach trial

It is important to note that, while the research suggests that the Peer Instruction teaching approach may be particularly beneficial for girls, we expect that a wide range of pupils will benefit. When we talk about boys' and girls' attitudes to computing throughout this course, we are basing the discussion on research that has suggested differences on average between them. We recognise that this does not necessarily reflect all pupils' experiences of computing.

In this project, we are asking two main questions. Does structured, collaborative activity in computing lessons:
+ make computing more accessible to a range of pupils?
+ improve girls' perception of computing?
